# GIS Project: Optimizing Commercial/Industrial Rooftop Solar Potential in Trier]

---

## 1. Project Overview

This GIS (Geographic Information System) project aims to identify and analyze optimal rooftop locations for photovoltaic (PV) solar panel installations on commercial and industrial buildings within Trier, Germany. Developed as a proof-of-concept for an internship application at Strrom GmbH, this project leverages geospatial data and analysis techniques to support sustainable energy development and reduce energy costs for businesses.

## 2. Project Goals

* **Identify High-Potential Rooftops:** Pinpoint commercial and industrial buildings with significant solar energy generation potential based on factors like roof area, orientation, slope, and solar irradiance.
* **Quantify Sustainability Impact:** Provide estimations of potential energy production and associated CO2 emission reductions for identified optimal sites.
* **Inform Strategic Planning:** Offer geospatial insights that could assist Strrom GmbH in targeting new clients, prioritizing project development, and potentially optimizing their operational network.

## 3. Methodology

This project utilizes a multi-criteria spatial analysis approach:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Sourcing relevant geospatial datasets for the study area.
2.  **Pre-processing:** Cleaning, reprojecting, and preparing raw data for analysis.
3.  **Rooftop Analysis:** Extracting and analyzing roof characteristics (area, slope, aspect) suitable for solar installation.
4.  **Solar Irradiance Calculation:** Estimating solar radiation received by suitable roof areas, accounting for shading.
5.  **Suitability Modeling:** Combining various criteria to rank and prioritize rooftops based on their solar potential.
6.  **Visualization:** Creating maps and potentially dashboards to present findings clearly.

## 4. Study Area

The primary study area for this proof-of-concept is **[Your Chosen City/Region, e.g., the city of Trier or "the Industrial Park Trier-Ehrang"]**, located in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

## 5. Data Sources

The following types of data are being utilized in this project:

* **Building Footprints:** [e.g., OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, local geodata portals like LVermGeo RLP]
* **Digital Surface Model (DSM) / Digital Elevation Model (DEM):** [e.g., Copernicus EU-DEM, data from state geoportals like LVermGeo RLP, if higher resolution is available]
* **Solar Irradiance Data:** [e.g., PVGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System), Global Solar Atlas]
* **Commercial/Industrial Zoning/Land Use Data (Optional):** [e.g., OpenStreetMap `landuse` tags, municipal planning data]

## 6. Tools & Technologies

* **GIS Software:** [e.g., QGIS / ArcGIS Pro]
* **Programming (Optional):** [e.g., Python with libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely (if you plan to use scripting)]
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

## 8. Next Steps & Future Work (Post-Internship)

Should this project evolve beyond the internship application, potential future enhancements include:

* Integrating real-world energy consumption data for more accurate savings estimations.
* Developing a more sophisticated 3D roof analysis using LiDAR data.
* Expanding the analysis to other regions or even a nationwide scale.
* Building an interactive web-GIS application for easier data exploration.
